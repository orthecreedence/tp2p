- converting Message/Event to be generic containers, so turtl-specific shit won't gum up
the protocol
- converting src/lib.rs to use the generics, but obvis it's a bitch and unfinished
- tests giving me grief as well
- currently stuck on Sync.process_incoming_message() -- the `PeerInit` event needs a list
of active topics to send back in the Confirm msg, however we don't have this at present,
and not sure where to get it from. i want to start removing state from the Sync object
and storing it somewhere else. does it pass in all possible state in each call? need some
way of passing in state only relevant to the current event.
